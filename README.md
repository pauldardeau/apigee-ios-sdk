This is a fork of Apigee iOS SDK (https://github.com/apigee/apigee-ios-sdk)

It is pared down for crash reporting and does not have any framework dependencies other than Foundation.framework.

To build, run './build.sh' from command line.

"Other Linker Flags" should be set to "-ObjC".

After build, static library and headers can be found in source/build/dist.
